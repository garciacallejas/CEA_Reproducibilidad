### About me

I am a community ecologist with a keen interest in understanding how ecological phenomena arise from interactions between entities in space and time. As such, I have so far focused my research on the structure and dynamics of ecological networks: how interactions of different types can be seamlessly incorporated in their representation, how species persist in these networks, and the role of space in shaping their dynamics.

I am actually integrating insights from species coexistence theory into this view of ecological communities as complex systems, by studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of a grassland ecosystem in the beautiful Doñana National Park (Spain).

With these lines of research, my overall aim is to contribute to applying ecological theory to conservation and restoration actions.

### About this website

In the sections above you will find a -hopefully- updated list of publications and CV, teaching resources from the classes/workshops I have imparted, and some occasional posts that I will write mostly to remind myself how to solve specific issues I encountered when playing with R, markdown, Latex, or any other fancy tool.
